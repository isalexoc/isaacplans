        },
        "1": {
          "q": "How are benefits paid out?",
          "a": "The carrier sends the cash benefit directly to you (check or direct deposit) usually within a few days of receiving your claim."
        },
        "2": {
          "q": "Is the policy portable if I change jobs or lose my major-medical coverage?",
          "a": "Yes. Hospital indemnity policies are individual contracts, so you can keep them as long as you pay the premiums—even if your employment or health plan changes."
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "Is there a waiting period before benefits begin?",
          "a": "Accident benefits typically start on Day 1; sickness benefits may have a 30-day waiting period, depending on the carrier."
        },
        "4": {
          "q": "Will this interfere with my regular health insurance?",
          "a": "No. Indemnity benefits are paid in addition to any other insurance you have and are not reduced by other reimbursements."
        },
        "5": {
          "q": "Are pre-existing conditions covered?",
          "a": "Many plans do cover them after a 6- or 12-month look-back period, but rules vary by carrier. Isaac will explain the specifics before you enroll."
        },
        "6": {
          "q": "How much does coverage cost?",
          "a": "Premiums depend on your age, benefit amount, and state of residence—many plans start under $1 a day."
