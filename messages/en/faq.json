      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?",
          "answer": "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is a federal law that provides access to affordable health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. It offers subsidies, tax credits, and ensures coverage for essential health benefits including preventive care, emergency services, and prescription drugs."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is the ACA Open Enrollment period?",
          "answer": "The annual Open Enrollment period typically runs from November 1 to January 15. During this time, you can enroll in a new plan, switch plans, or renew your existing coverage. Outside of Open Enrollment, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you experience a qualifying life event such as marriage, birth of a child, loss of other coverage, or moving to a new area."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are premium tax credits and how do I qualify?",
          "answer": "Premium tax credits are subsidies that help lower your monthly health insurance premiums. You may qualify if your household income is between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. The credits are based on your income, family size, and the cost of coverage in your area. You can apply the credit directly to your monthly premium or claim it when you file your taxes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the metal tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)?",
          "answer": "Metal tiers indicate how you and your insurance plan share costs. Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but highest out-of-pocket costs (60% plan coverage). Silver plans cover about 70% of costs. Gold plans cover about 80% with higher premiums. Platinum plans have the highest premiums but cover about 90% of costs. The tier you choose depends on how often you expect to use medical services."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are essential health benefits?",
          "answer": "All ACA plans must cover 10 essential health benefits: ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventive and wellness services, and pediatric services including oral and vision care."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions?",
          "answer": "No. Under the ACA, insurance companies cannot deny you coverage or charge you more because of a pre-existing condition. This protection applies to all health conditions you had before your coverage started, including diabetes, cancer, asthma, and pregnancy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a Special Enrollment Period?",
          "answer": "A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) allows you to enroll in or change your health plan outside of Open Enrollment if you experience a qualifying life event. These events include losing health coverage, getting married or divorced, having a baby, adopting a child, moving to a new area, or becoming a U.S. citizen. You typically have 60 days from the event to enroll."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I estimate my premium tax credit?",
          "answer": "You can estimate your premium tax credit using the Marketplace's online calculator or by working with a licensed agent. The credit is based on your estimated household income for the year, family size, and the cost of the second-lowest-cost Silver plan in your area. The Marketplace will verify your income and adjust your credit accordingly."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between a Health Savings Account (HSA) and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA)?",
          "answer": "An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account you can use to pay for qualified medical expenses. You can only contribute to an HSA if you have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). An HRA is an employer-funded account that reimburses employees for qualified medical expenses. Unlike HSAs, HRAs are owned and funded by employers, not employees."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I keep my current doctor with an ACA plan?",
          "answer": "This depends on whether your doctor is in the plan's network. Before enrolling, check the plan's provider directory to see if your current doctors, hospitals, and specialists are included. If maintaining relationships with specific providers is important, look for plans that include them in their network."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I don't have health insurance?",
          "answer": "While the federal penalty for not having health insurance was eliminated in 2019, some states have their own individual mandates with penalties. More importantly, going without insurance leaves you financially vulnerable to high medical costs. Even a simple emergency room visit can cost thousands of dollars without coverage."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose the right ACA plan for my family?",
          "answer": "Consider your family's health needs, budget, preferred doctors and hospitals, and expected medical expenses. Compare plan networks, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. A licensed agent can help you evaluate your options and find a plan that balances coverage and cost for your specific situation."

    "shortTermMedical": {
      "title": "Short Term Medical",
      "description": "Temporary health insurance coverage for gaps between major medical plans, offering quick enrollment and flexible terms.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is Short Term Medical insurance?",
          "answer": "Short Term Medical (STM) insurance provides temporary health coverage for periods typically ranging from 30 days to 12 months, with some plans allowing renewals up to 36 months. It's designed to fill coverage gaps when you're between jobs, waiting for ACA enrollment, or in other transitional situations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who is Short Term Medical insurance best for?",
          "answer": "STM is ideal for healthy individuals who need temporary coverage during life transitions such as job changes, recent college graduates waiting for employer coverage, early retirees before Medicare eligibility, or those waiting for ACA Open Enrollment. It's not suitable for those with pre-existing conditions or who need comprehensive preventive care."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly can I get coverage with Short Term Medical?",
          "answer": "Short Term Medical plans typically offer very quick enrollment, often providing coverage that starts within 24-48 hours of application approval. This makes it an excellent option when you need immediate coverage and can't wait for the next Open Enrollment period."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does Short Term Medical insurance cover?",
          "answer": "STM plans generally cover unexpected illnesses and injuries, emergency room visits, hospital stays, surgery, and some diagnostic tests. Coverage varies by plan, but most do not cover preventive care, pre-existing conditions, maternity care, mental health services, or prescription drugs. Always review the specific plan details before enrolling."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I be denied Short Term Medical coverage?",
          "answer": "Yes, unlike ACA plans, Short Term Medical insurers can deny coverage based on your health history, pre-existing conditions, or medical underwriting. They may also exclude coverage for specific conditions or charge higher premiums based on your health status."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long can I keep Short Term Medical insurance?",
          "answer": "Short Term Medical plans typically last from 30 days to 12 months, depending on state regulations and the specific plan. Some states allow renewals or extensions up to 36 months total. However, coverage terms vary by state, so check your local regulations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Short Term Medical cheaper than ACA plans?",
          "answer": "Short Term Medical often has lower monthly premiums than ACA plans because it offers less comprehensive coverage and can exclude pre-existing conditions. However, it may have higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The total cost depends on your health needs and how much you use medical services."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use Short Term Medical if I have a pre-existing condition?",
          "answer": "Most Short Term Medical plans exclude pre-existing conditions, meaning they won't cover treatment for conditions you had before the policy started. Some plans may offer limited coverage after a waiting period, but this varies by plan and state. If you have ongoing health needs, an ACA plan may be more appropriate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens when my Short Term Medical plan expires?",
          "answer": "When your STM plan expires, you'll need to either renew it (if allowed in your state), enroll in an ACA plan during Open Enrollment or a Special Enrollment Period, obtain employer coverage, or go without insurance. Plan ahead to avoid coverage gaps."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Short Term Medical cover preventive care?",
          "answer": "Most Short Term Medical plans do not cover preventive care such as annual physicals, vaccinations, mammograms, or colonoscopies. These services are typically covered by ACA plans but are generally excluded from STM policies. You'll pay out-of-pocket for preventive services with STM."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I get Short Term Medical if I'm eligible for ACA coverage?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can purchase Short Term Medical even if you're eligible for ACA coverage. However, STM doesn't satisfy the individual mandate in states that have one, and you won't receive premium tax credits. Consider your options carefully and consult with a licensed agent to determine what's best for your situation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I consider before choosing Short Term Medical?",
          "answer": "Before choosing STM, consider your health status, how long you need coverage, whether you have pre-existing conditions, your budget, and what services you're likely to need. Review plan exclusions, deductibles, copayments, and coverage limits carefully. If you need comprehensive coverage or have ongoing health needs, an ACA plan may be more suitable."

    "dentalVision": {
      "title": "Dental & Vision",
      "description": "Affordable dental and vision insurance plans to help maintain your oral and eye health with coverage for exams, cleanings, and treatments.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Why do I need separate dental and vision insurance?",
          "answer": "While some health plans include limited dental and vision benefits for children, most adult health insurance plans don't cover routine dental cleanings, eye exams, or corrective lenses. Separate dental and vision insurance helps you maintain oral and eye health affordably, covering preventive care, treatments, and sometimes orthodontics or LASIK surgery."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does dental insurance typically cover?",
          "answer": "Dental insurance usually covers preventive care (cleanings, exams, X-rays) at 100%, basic procedures (fillings, extractions) at 70-80%, and major procedures (crowns, root canals, bridges) at 50%. Most plans have an annual maximum benefit (typically $1,000-$2,000) and may include orthodontic coverage for children. Coverage varies by plan type."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does vision insurance cover?",
          "answer": "Vision insurance typically covers annual eye exams, prescription glasses or contact lenses (usually with a copay or allowance), and sometimes discounts on LASIK surgery. Coverage may include frames, lenses, and contact lens fittings. Benefits are usually provided annually, and coverage limits vary by plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I get dental and vision coverage together?",
          "answer": "Yes, many insurers offer combined dental and vision plans that provide both types of coverage in a single policy. These bundled plans can be more convenient and sometimes more cost-effective than purchasing separate policies. You can also purchase standalone dental or vision plans if you only need one type of coverage."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there waiting periods for dental coverage?",
          "answer": "Many dental plans have waiting periods for major procedures (typically 6-12 months) and orthodontics (often 12-24 months). Preventive care is usually covered immediately or after a short waiting period (30-90 days). Waiting periods help prevent people from enrolling only when they need expensive treatments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between DHMO and DPPO dental plans?",
          "answer": "A DHMO (Dental Health Maintenance Organization) requires you to see dentists within a specific network and typically has lower premiums and no deductibles, but less flexibility. A DPPO (Dental Preferred Provider Organization) allows you to see any dentist but offers better benefits and lower costs when you use in-network providers. DPPOs usually have deductibles and higher premiums."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does vision insurance cover LASIK surgery?",
          "answer": "Most vision insurance plans don't fully cover LASIK surgery but may offer discounts (typically 10-20% off) at participating providers. Some premium plans may provide a small benefit toward LASIK. If you're considering LASIK, check the specific plan details and compare costs with and without insurance discounts."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use my dental insurance immediately?",
          "answer": "Preventive care (cleanings, exams, X-rays) is usually covered immediately or after a short waiting period (30-90 days). However, basic and major procedures often have waiting periods of 3-12 months. Orthodontic coverage typically requires a 12-24 month waiting period. Check your specific plan for exact waiting periods."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I exceed my annual dental maximum?",
          "answer": "If you exceed your annual maximum benefit (typically $1,000-$2,000), you'll be responsible for 100% of additional costs until the next benefit year when your maximum resets. Some plans offer rollover benefits or higher maximums for an additional premium. Consider your expected dental needs when choosing a plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are orthodontics covered under dental insurance?",
          "answer": "Many dental plans include orthodontic coverage, especially for children, but it's often subject to a separate lifetime maximum (typically $1,000-$2,000) and a waiting period (usually 12-24 months). Adult orthodontics may have limited coverage or higher copays. Review plan details carefully if orthodontic treatment is a priority."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often can I get an eye exam with vision insurance?",
          "answer": "Most vision insurance plans cover one comprehensive eye exam per calendar year. Some plans may allow exams every 12 months from your last exam date. Additional exams may be covered if medically necessary, but routine exams are typically limited to once per year."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between vision insurance and a vision discount plan?",
          "answer": "Vision insurance provides specific benefits (like an annual exam allowance and frame/lens benefits) with copays and coverage limits. A vision discount plan offers percentage discounts (typically 20-40% off) on services and products at participating providers but doesn't provide fixed benefits. Discount plans usually have lower monthly costs but may not save as much if you need comprehensive services."

    "hospitalIndemnity": {
      "title": "Hospital Indemnity",
      "description": "Supplemental insurance that pays cash benefits directly to you when you're hospitalized, helping cover expenses not covered by your primary health insurance.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is Hospital Indemnity insurance?",
          "answer": "Hospital Indemnity insurance is a type of supplemental insurance that pays you fixed cash benefits (a set dollar amount per day) when you're hospitalized. Unlike traditional health insurance that pays providers, Hospital Indemnity pays benefits directly to you, which you can use for any purpose - medical bills, lost income, household expenses, or other needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Hospital Indemnity insurance work?",
          "answer": "When you're admitted to a hospital, your Hospital Indemnity plan pays a daily benefit (for example, $100-$500 per day) for each day you're hospitalized, up to a maximum number of days. Benefits are paid directly to you, not to the hospital. Some plans also pay benefits for emergency room visits, ambulance services, or intensive care unit stays."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need Hospital Indemnity if I already have health insurance?",
          "answer": "Hospital Indemnity can be valuable even if you have health insurance because it provides additional cash benefits to help cover deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out-of-pocket costs. It can also help replace lost income if you can't work while hospitalized. It's particularly useful if you have a high-deductible health plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "What expenses can I use Hospital Indemnity benefits for?",
          "answer": "You can use Hospital Indemnity benefits for any purpose - medical bills, deductibles, copays, household expenses, mortgage or rent payments, childcare, transportation, lost income, or any other expenses you incur while hospitalized. The money is paid directly to you, so you decide how to use it."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does Hospital Indemnity insurance cost?",
          "answer": "Premiums vary based on your age, gender, location, benefit amount, and coverage options. Typical monthly premiums range from $20-$100+ depending on the daily benefit amount and maximum benefit period. Plans with higher daily benefits and longer benefit periods cost more."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there waiting periods for Hospital Indemnity coverage?",
          "answer": "Many Hospital Indemnity plans have a waiting period (typically 30-90 days) before coverage begins for illness-related hospitalizations. Accident-related hospitalizations are usually covered immediately. Pre-existing conditions may have longer waiting periods or exclusions. Check your specific plan for details."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Hospital Indemnity cover pre-existing conditions?",
          "answer": "Coverage for pre-existing conditions varies by plan. Some plans exclude pre-existing conditions entirely, while others may cover them after a waiting period (often 12-24 months). Accident-related hospitalizations are typically covered regardless of pre-existing conditions. Review plan exclusions carefully."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between Hospital Indemnity and Critical Illness insurance?",
          "answer": "Hospital Indemnity pays daily benefits for each day you're hospitalized, regardless of the reason. Critical Illness insurance pays a lump-sum benefit (often $10,000-$100,000+) when you're diagnosed with a specific critical illness like cancer, heart attack, or stroke. Both are supplemental and can work together to provide comprehensive protection."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I get Hospital Indemnity insurance if I'm on Medicare?",
          "answer": "Yes, Hospital Indemnity insurance can complement Medicare coverage. It can help cover Medicare deductibles, copays, and other out-of-pocket costs. However, be aware that some Hospital Indemnity plans may have restrictions or different benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, so review plan details carefully."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do Hospital Indemnity benefits last?",
          "answer": "Benefits typically last for a specified number of days per hospitalization (often 30-365 days) and may have a maximum benefit period per year or lifetime. Some plans have unlimited benefit periods. The length of benefits depends on your specific plan and the daily benefit amount you selected."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do Hospital Indemnity benefits coordinate with my health insurance?",
          "answer": "Hospital Indemnity benefits are paid independently of your health insurance. You receive the benefits regardless of what your health insurance covers or pays. This means you can use the cash benefits to help pay your health insurance deductibles, copays, or any other expenses."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I consider when choosing a Hospital Indemnity plan?",
          "answer": "Consider the daily benefit amount (how much per day), maximum benefit period (how many days covered), waiting periods, coverage for accidents vs. illnesses, pre-existing condition exclusions, premium costs, and whether the plan offers additional benefits like ICU coverage or emergency room benefits. Choose a plan that fits your budget and provides adequate protection."

      "title": "IUL - Indexed Universal Life",
      "description": "Flexible permanent life insurance with cash value growth potential tied to market indexes, offering both protection and wealth accumulation.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is Indexed Universal Life (IUL) insurance?",
          "answer": "Indexed Universal Life (IUL) is a type of permanent life insurance that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. The cash value can grow based on the performance of stock market indexes (like the S&P 500) while providing downside protection - your cash value won't lose value due to market declines, though it may not earn interest in down years."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the cash value in an IUL policy grow?",
          "answer": "IUL cash value growth is tied to the performance of stock market indexes (typically the S&P 500). When the index performs well, your cash value can earn interest up to a cap (often 10-15%). When the index performs poorly, your cash value is protected from losses with a floor (typically 0%). The insurance company credits interest based on index performance within these parameters."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the main benefits of IUL insurance?",
          "answer": "IUL offers several benefits: permanent life insurance protection, tax-deferred cash value growth, potential for higher returns than traditional whole life, downside protection from market losses, flexible premium payments, ability to access cash value through loans or withdrawals, and potential tax-free death benefit for beneficiaries."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I access the cash value in my IUL policy?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can access your IUL cash value through policy loans (which accrue interest but don't require credit checks) or withdrawals (which may reduce your death benefit). Loans and withdrawals may have tax implications, and unpaid loans reduce the death benefit. Consult with a financial advisor about the best way to access your cash value."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between IUL and whole life insurance?",
          "answer": "IUL offers flexible premiums and cash value growth tied to market indexes with caps and floors. Whole life has fixed premiums and guaranteed cash value growth at a fixed interest rate. IUL has potential for higher returns but less guarantees, while whole life offers more guarantees but typically lower returns. Both are permanent life insurance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are IUL policies suitable for retirement planning?",
          "answer": "IUL can be used for retirement planning because the cash value grows tax-deferred and can be accessed tax-free through policy loans. However, IUL is a long-term commitment requiring consistent premium payments. It's best suited for those who can commit to the policy for 15+ years and want both life insurance protection and cash accumulation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the tax advantages of IUL insurance?",
          "answer": "IUL offers several tax advantages: cash value grows tax-deferred, policy loans are generally tax-free, death benefits are typically income tax-free for beneficiaries, and withdrawals up to your basis (premiums paid) are usually tax-free. However, tax laws can change, and individual situations vary, so consult with a tax advisor."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I stop paying premiums on my IUL policy?",
          "answer": "If you stop paying premiums, the policy will use cash value to cover costs. If cash value is insufficient, the policy may lapse. Some policies have a no-lapse guarantee rider that keeps the policy in force even if cash value is depleted, as long as minimum premiums are paid. Review your policy's specific terms."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I increase or decrease my IUL death benefit?",
          "answer": "Yes, IUL policies typically offer flexibility to increase or decrease the death benefit (subject to underwriting for increases and minimum requirements for decreases). Increasing the death benefit may require additional premiums, while decreasing it may reduce your premium requirements. Changes may have tax implications."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a cap and floor in IUL policies?",
          "answer": "The cap is the maximum interest rate your cash value can earn in a given period (often 10-15%), even if the index performs better. The floor is the minimum interest rate (typically 0%), protecting you from losses when the index performs poorly. These features provide upside potential with downside protection."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does it take for an IUL policy to build significant cash value?",
          "answer": "IUL cash value accumulation is a long-term process. It typically takes 10-15 years for meaningful cash value to accumulate, depending on premium payments, index performance, policy fees, and the death benefit amount.

          "question": "Is IUL insurance right for me?",
          "answer": "IUL may be right if you need permanent life insurance, want cash value growth potential, can commit to long-term premium payments (15+ years), understand the risks and benefits, and have maxed out other retirement savings options. It's not suitable for short-term needs, those who can't afford consistent premiums, or those seeking guaranteed returns. Consult with a licensed agent to evaluate if IUL fits your financial goals."

        {
          "question": "What is Final Expense insurance?",
          "answer": "Final Expense insurance (also called burial insurance or funeral insurance) is a type of whole life insurance designed to cover end-of-life expenses such as funeral costs, burial or cremation expenses, medical bills, outstanding debts, and other final expenses. It typically offers smaller death benefits ($5,000-$50,000) and is easier to qualify for than traditional life insurance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who needs Final Expense insurance?",
          "answer": "Final Expense insurance is ideal for seniors (typically age 50-85) who want to ensure their funeral and final expenses are covered without burdening their family. It's also suitable for those who may not qualify for traditional life insurance due to health issues, have limited savings, or want to leave a specific amount for final expenses."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much Final Expense insurance do I need?",
          "answer": "The amount you need depends on your expected funeral costs (typically $7,000-$15,000), outstanding medical bills, debts you want to cover, and any additional expenses. Most people purchase $10,000-$25,000 in coverage. Consider your specific situation, local funeral costs, and what you want to leave for your family."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Final Expense insurance easier to qualify for than traditional life insurance?",
          "answer": "Yes, Final Expense insurance typically has more lenient underwriting than traditional life insurance. Many plans offer guaranteed acceptance (no health questions) or simplified issue (few health questions, no medical exam). However, guaranteed acceptance plans may have waiting periods before full benefits are paid, and premiums may be higher."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a graded death benefit?",
          "answer": "A graded death benefit means that if you die within the first 2-3 years of the policy, your beneficiaries receive a limited benefit (typically return of premiums plus interest) rather than the full death benefit. After the graded period, the full death benefit is paid. This is common with guaranteed acceptance Final Expense policies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I be denied Final Expense insurance?",
          "answer": "With guaranteed acceptance plans, you cannot be denied coverage regardless of your health. However, these plans may have waiting periods and higher premiums. Simplified issue plans may deny coverage based on serious health conditions, but they typically don't require medical exams and have shorter or no waiting periods."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does Final Expense insurance cost?",
          "answer": "Premiums vary based on age, gender, health, coverage amount, and plan type. Typical monthly premiums range from $30-$150+ for $10,000-$25,000 in coverage. Guaranteed acceptance plans cost more than simplified issue plans. Premiums are usually fixed and won't increase as you age."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Final Expense insurance build cash value?",
          "answer": "Yes, most Final Expense insurance is whole life insurance, which means it builds cash value over time. You can borrow against the cash value or surrender the policy for its cash value, though this reduces or eliminates the death benefit. Cash value accumulation is typically slower than with larger life insurance policies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use Final Expense insurance while I'm alive?",
          "answer": "Some Final Expense policies offer living benefits (accelerated death benefits) that allow you to access a portion of the death benefit if you're diagnosed with a terminal illness. You can also access cash value through policy loans or withdrawals, though this reduces the death benefit. Check your specific policy for available options."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I stop paying Final Expense premiums?",
          "answer": "If you stop paying premiums, the policy may lapse and you'll lose coverage. Some policies have a grace period (typically 30 days) and may use cash value to pay premiums if available. Some policies offer reduced paid-up insurance, which provides a smaller death benefit without further premiums. Review your policy terms carefully."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I add Final Expense insurance to my existing life insurance?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can purchase Final Expense insurance even if you have other life insurance. It can supplement your existing coverage to specifically cover final expenses, or you may purchase it if your existing policy isn't sufficient for final expenses. There's no limit on how much life insurance you can own."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose the right Final Expense insurance plan?",
          "answer": "Consider the coverage amount you need, whether you want guaranteed acceptance or simplified issue, premium affordability, waiting periods, cash value features, company financial strength, and policy flexibility. Work with a licensed agent who can compare multiple carriers and help you find a plan that fits your needs and budget."
